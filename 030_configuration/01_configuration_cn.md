## [3. 配置](#configuration)<a id="configuration"></a>

Kafka 使用 [**property file 格式**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties) 键值对进行配置。这些数值可以通过文件或者编程形式指定。

### [3.1 Broker 配置](#brokerconfigs)<a id="brokerconfigs"></a>

核心的必要配置信息如下：

* `broker.id`
* `log.dirs`
* `zookeeper.connect`

Topic 级别的配置和默认值在[下面](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#topic-config) 进行更深入的讨论。

更多关于 broker 的配置信息可以在 scala 类 `kafka.server.KafkaConfig` 中找到。

[**Topic 级别配置**](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#topic-config) 与 Topic 相关的配置既包含服务器默认值，也包含可选的每个 Topic 覆盖值。如果没有给出 Topic 单独的配置，那么服务器全局配置就会被使用。Topic 的配置可以在创建时通过一个或者多个 `--config` 选项来提供。本示例使用自定义的最大消息大小和刷新率创建一个名为 _my-topic_ 的 topic:

```
 > bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --create --topic my-topic --partitions 1
        --replication-factor 1 --config max.message.bytes=64000 --config flush.messages=1

```

也可以在使用 `alter configs` 命令稍后更改或设置覆盖值。本示例重置 _my-topic_ 的最大消息的大小：

```
 > bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --alter --topic my-topic
    --config max.message.bytes=128000

```

移除一个设置可以通过如下方法：

```
 > bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --alter --topic my-topic
    --delete-config max.message.bytes

```

下面是 Topic 级别配置，服务器默认属性列是该属性的默认配置，修改该属性的服务器级别设置可以用来改变 Topic 的属性。

| 名称 | 默认值 | 服务器默认属性 | 描述 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cleanup.policy | delete | log.cleanup.policy | A string that is either "delete" or "compact". This string designates the retention policy to use on old log segments. The default policy \("delete"\) will discard old segments when their retention time or size limit has been reached. The "compact" setting will enable [**log compaction**](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#compaction) on the topic. |
| delete.retention.ms | 86400000 \(24 hours\) | log.cleaner.delete.retention.ms | The amount of time to retain delete tombstone markers for [**log compacted**](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#compaction) topics. This setting also gives a bound on the time in which a consumer must complete a read if they begin from offset 0 to ensure that they get a valid snapshot of the final stage \(otherwise delete tombstones may be collected before they complete their scan\). |
| flush.messages | None | log.flush.interval.messages | This setting allows specifying an interval at which we will force an fsync of data written to the log. For example if this was set to 1 we would fsync after every message; if it were 5 we would fsync after every five messages. In general we recommend you not set this and use replication for durability and allow the operating system's background flush capabilities as it is more efficient. This setting can be overridden on a per-topic basis \(see [**the per-topic configuration section**](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#topic-config)\). |
| flush.ms | None | log.flush.interval.ms | This setting allows specifying a time interval at which we will force an fsync of data written to the log. For example if this was set to 1000 we would fsync after 1000 ms had passed. In general we recommend you not set this and use replication for durability and allow the operating system's background flush capabilities as it is more efficient. |
| index.interval.bytes | 4096 | log.index.interval.bytes | This setting controls how frequently Kafka adds an index entry to it's offset index. The default setting ensures that we index a message roughly every 4096 bytes. More indexing allows reads to jump closer to the exact position in the log but makes the index larger. You probably don't need to change this. |
| max.message.bytes | 1,000,000 | message.max.bytes | This is largest message size Kafka will allow to be appended to this topic. Note that if you increase this size you must also increase your consumer's fetch size so they can fetch messages this large. |
| min.cleanable.dirty.ratio | 0.5 | log.cleaner.min.cleanable.ratio | This configuration controls how frequently the log compactor will attempt to clean the log \(assuming [**log compaction**](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#compaction) is enabled\). By default we will avoid cleaning a log where more than 50% of the log has been compacted. This ratio bounds the maximum space wasted in the log by duplicates \(at 50% at most 50% of the log could be duplicates\). A higher ratio will mean fewer, more efficient cleanings but will mean more wasted space in the log. |
| min.insync.replicas | 1 | min.insync.replicas | When a producer sets acks to "all", min.insync.replicas specifies the minimum number of replicas that must acknowledge a write for the write to be considered successful. If this minimum cannot be met, then the producer will raise an exception \(either NotEnoughReplicas or NotEnoughReplicasAfterAppend\). When used together, min.insync.replicas and acks allow you to enforce greater durability guarantees. A typical scenario would be to create a topic with a replication factor of 3, set min.insync.replicas to 2, and produce with acks of "all". This will ensure that the producer raises an exception if a majority of replicas do not receive a write. |
| retention.bytes | None | log.retention.bytes | This configuration controls the maximum size a log can grow to before we will discard old log segments to free up space if we are using the "delete" retention policy. By default there is no size limit only a time limit. |
| retention.ms | 7 days | log.retention.minutes | This configuration controls the maximum time we will retain a log before we will discard old log segments to free up space if we are using the "delete" retention policy. This represents an SLA on how soon consumers must read their data. |
| segment.bytes | 1 GB | log.segment.bytes | This configuration controls the segment file size for the log. Retention and cleaning is always done a file at a time so a larger segment size means fewer files but less granular control over retention. |
| segment.index.bytes | 10 MB | log.index.size.max.bytes | This configuration controls the size of the index that maps offsets to file positions. We preallocate this index file and shrink it only after log rolls. You generally should not need to change this setting. |
| segment.ms | 7 days | log.roll.hours | This configuration controls the period of time after which Kafka will force the log to roll even if the segment file isn't full to ensure that retention can delete or compact old data. |
| segment.jitter.ms | 0 | log.roll.jitter.{ms,hours} | The maximum jitter to subtract from logRollTimeMillis. |

### [3.2 Producer 配置](#producerconfigs)<a id="producerconfigs"></a>

下面是 Java 生产者的配置：

| 名称 | 描述 | 类型 | 默认值 | 有效值 | 重要性 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| bootstrap.servers | A list of host\/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster. The client will make use of all servers irrespective of which servers are specified here for bootstrapping—this list only impacts the initial hosts used to discover the full set of servers. This list should be in the form`host1:port1,host2:port2,...`. Since these servers are just used for the initial connection to discover the full cluster membership \(which may change dynamically\), this list need not contain the full set of servers \(you may want more than one, though, in case a server is down\). | list |  |  | high |
| key.serializer | Serializer class for key that implements the`Serializer` interface. | class |  |  | high |
| value.serializer | Serializer class for value that implements the`Serializer` interface. | class |  |  | high |
| acks | The number of acknowledgments the producer requires the leader to have received before considering a request complete. This controls the durability of records that are sent. The following settings are common:`acks=0` If set to zero then the producer will not wait for any acknowledgment from the server at all. The record will be immediately added to the socket buffer and considered sent. No guarantee can be made that the server has received the record in this case, and the`retries` configuration will not take effect \(as the client won't generally know of any failures\). The offset given back for each record will always be set to -1.`acks=1` This will mean the leader will write the record to its local log but will respond without awaiting full acknowledgement from all followers. In this case should the leader fail immediately after acknowledging the record but before the followers have replicated it then the record will be lost.`acks=all` This means the leader will wait for the full set of in-sync replicas to acknowledge the record. This guarantees that the record will not be lost as long as at least one in-sync replica remains alive. This is the strongest available guarantee. | string | 1 | \[all, -1, 0, 1\] | high |
| buffer.memory | The total bytes of memory the producer can use to buffer records waiting to be sent to the server. If records are sent faster than they can be delivered to the server the producer will block for`max.block.ms` after which it will throw an exception.This setting should correspond roughly to the total memory the producer will use, but is not a hard bound since not all memory the producer uses is used for buffering. Some additional memory will be used for compression \(if compression is enabled\) as well as for maintaining in-flight requests. | long | 33554432 | \[0,...\] | high |
| compression.type | The compression type for all data generated by the producer. The default is none \(i.e. no compression\). Valid values are `none`, `gzip`, `snappy`, or `lz4`. Compression is of full batches of data, so the efficacy of batching will also impact the compression ratio \(more batching means better compression\). | string | none |  | high |
| retries | Setting a value greater than zero will cause the client to resend any record whose send fails with a potentially transient error. Note that this retry is no different than if the client resent the record upon receiving the error. Allowing retries without setting`max.in.flight.requests.per.connection`to 1 will potentially change the ordering of records because if two batches are sent to a single partition, and the first fails and is retried but the second succeeds, then the records in the second batch may appear first. | int | 0 | \[0,...,2147483647\] | high |
| ssl.key.password | The password of the private key in the key store file. This is optional for client. | password | null |  | high |
| ssl.keystore.location | The location of the key store file. This is optional for client and can be used for two-way authentication for client. | string | null |  | high |
| ssl.keystore.password | The store password for the key store file.This is optional for client and only needed if ssl.keystore.location is configured. | password | null |  | high |
| ssl.truststore.location | The location of the trust store file. | string | null |  | high |
| ssl.truststore.password | The password for the trust store file. | password | null |  | high |
| batch.size | The producer will attempt to batch records together into fewer requests whenever multiple records are being sent to the same partition. This helps performance on both the client and the server. This configuration controls the default batch size in bytes.No attempt will be made to batch records larger than this size.Requests sent to brokers will contain multiple batches, one for each partition with data available to be sent.A small batch size will make batching less common and may reduce throughput \(a batch size of zero will disable batching entirely\). A very large batch size may use memory a bit more wastefully as we will always allocate a buffer of the specified batch size in anticipation of additional records. | int | 16384 | \[0,...\] | medium |
| client.id | An id string to pass to the server when making requests. The purpose of this is to be able to track the source of requests beyond just ip\/port by allowing a logical application name to be included in server-side request logging. | string | "" |  | medium |
| connections.max.idle.ms | Close idle connections after the number of milliseconds specified by this config. | long | 540000 |  | medium |
| linger.ms | The producer groups together any records that arrive in between request transmissions into a single batched request. Normally this occurs only under load when records arrive faster than they can be sent out. However in some circumstances the client may want to reduce the number of requests even under moderate load. This setting accomplishes this by adding a small amount of artificial delay—that is, rather than immediately sending out a record the producer will wait for up to the given delay to allow other records to be sent so that the sends can be batched together. This can be thought of as analogous to Nagle's algorithm in TCP. This setting gives the upper bound on the delay for batching: once we get `batch.size` worth of records for a partition it will be sent immediately regardless of this setting, however if we have fewer than this many bytes accumulated for this partition we will 'linger' for the specified time waiting for more records to show up. This setting defaults to 0 \(i.e. no delay\). Setting `linger.ms=5`, for example, would have the effect of reducing the number of requests sent but would add up to 5ms of latency to records sent in the absense of load. | long | 0 | \[0,...\] | medium |
| max.block.ms | The configuration controls how long`KafkaProducer.send()` and`KafkaProducer.partitionsFor()` will block.These methods can be blocked either because the buffer is full or metadata unavailable.Blocking in the user-supplied serializers or partitioner will not be counted against this timeout. | long | 60000 | \[0,...\] | medium |
| max.request.size | The maximum size of a request in bytes. This is also effectively a cap on the maximum record size. Note that the server has its own cap on record size which may be different from this. This setting will limit the number of record batches the producer will send in a single request to avoid sending huge requests. | int | 1048576 | \[0,...\] | medium |
| partitioner.class | Partitioner class that implements the`Partitioner` interface. | class | class org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.internals.DefaultPartitioner |  | medium |
| receive.buffer.bytes | The size of the TCP receive buffer \(SO\_RCVBUF\) to use when reading data. | int | 32768 | \[0,...\] | medium |
| request.timeout.ms | The configuration controls the maximum amount of time the client will wait for the response of a request. If the response is not received before the timeout elapses the client will resend the request if necessary or fail the request if retries are exhausted. | int | 30000 | \[0,...\] | medium |
| sasl.kerberos.service.name | The Kerberos principal name that Kafka runs as. This can be defined either in Kafka's JAAS config or in Kafka's config. | string | null |  | medium |
| sasl.mechanism | SASL mechanism used for client connections. This may be any mechanism for which a security provider is available. GSSAPI is the default mechanism. | string | GSSAPI |  | medium |
| security.protocol | Protocol used to communicate with brokers. Valid values are: PLAINTEXT, SSL, SASL\_PLAINTEXT, SASL\_SSL. | string | PLAINTEXT |  | medium |
| send.buffer.bytes | The size of the TCP send buffer \(SO\_SNDBUF\) to use when sending data. | int | 131072 | \[0,...\] | medium |
| ssl.enabled.protocols | The list of protocols enabled for SSL connections. | list | \[TLSv1.2, TLSv1.1, TLSv1\] |  | medium |
| ssl.keystore.type | The file format of the key store file. This is optional for client. | string | JKS |  | medium |
| ssl.protocol | The SSL protocol used to generate the SSLContext. Default setting is TLS, which is fine for most cases. Allowed values in recent JVMs are TLS, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2. SSL, SSLv2 and SSLv3 may be supported in older JVMs, but their usage is discouraged due to known security vulnerabilities. | string | TLS |  | medium |
| ssl.provider | The name of the security provider used for SSL connections. Default value is the default security provider of the JVM. | string | null |  | medium |
| ssl.truststore.type | The file format of the trust store file. | string | JKS |  | medium |
| timeout.ms | The configuration controls the maximum amount of time the server will wait for acknowledgments from followers to meet the acknowledgment requirements the producer has specified with the `acks`configuration. If the requested number of acknowledgments are not met when the timeout elapses an error will be returned. This timeout is measured on the server side and does not include the network latency of the request. | int | 30000 | \[0,...\] | medium |
| block.on.buffer.full | When our memory buffer is exhausted we must either stop accepting new records \(block\) or throw errors. By default this setting is false and the producer will no longer throw a BufferExhaustException but instead will use the`max.block.ms` value to block, after which it will throw a TimeoutException. Setting this property to true will set the `max.block.ms` to Long.MAX\_VALUE. _Also if this property is set to true, parameter __`metadata.fetch.timeout.ms`__ is not longer honored._This parameter is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Parameter `max.block.ms` should be used instead. | boolean | false |  | low |
| interceptor.classes | A list of classes to use as interceptors. Implementing the `ProducerInterceptor` interface allows you to intercept \(and possibly mutate\) the records received by the producer before they are published to the Kafka cluster. By default, there are no interceptors. | list | null |  | low |
| max.in.flight.requests.per.connection | The maximum number of unacknowledged requests the client will send on a single connection before blocking. Note that if this setting is set to be greater than 1 and there are failed sends, there is a risk of message re-ordering due to retries \(i.e., if retries are enabled\). | int | 5 | \[1,...\] | low |
| metadata.fetch.timeout.ms | The first time data is sent to a topic we must fetch metadata about that topic to know which servers host the topic's partitions. This fetch to succeed before throwing an exception back to the client. | long | 60000 | \[0,...\] | low |
| metadata.max.age.ms | The period of time in milliseconds after which we force a refresh of metadata even if we haven't seen any partition leadership changes to proactively discover any new brokers or partitions. | long | 300000 | \[0,...\] | low |
| metric.reporters | A list of classes to use as metrics reporters. Implementing the `MetricReporter` interface allows plugging in classes that will be notified of new metric creation. The JmxReporter is always included to register JMX statistics. | list | \[\] |  | low |
| metrics.num.samples | The number of samples maintained to compute metrics. | int | 2 | \[1,...\] | low |
| metrics.sample.window.ms | The window of time a metrics sample is computed over. | long | 30000 | \[0,...\] | low |
| reconnect.backoff.ms | The amount of time to wait before attempting to reconnect to a given host. This avoids repeatedly connecting to a host in a tight loop. This backoff applies to all requests sent by the consumer to the broker. | long | 50 | \[0,...\] | low |
| retry.backoff.ms | The amount of time to wait before attempting to retry a failed request to a given topic partition. This avoids repeatedly sending requests in a tight loop under some failure scenarios. | long | 100 | \[0,...\] | low |
| sasl.kerberos.kinit.cmd | Kerberos kinit command path. | string | \/usr\/bin\/kinit |  | low |

### [3.3 Consumer Configs](#consumerconfigs)<a id="consumerconfigs"></a>

We introduce both the old 0.8 consumer configs and the new consumer configs respectively below.

#### [3.3.1 Old Consumer Configs](#oldconsumerconfigs)<a id="oldconsumerconfigs"></a>

The essential old consumer configurations are the following:

* `group.id`
* `zookeeper.connect`

| **PropertyDefaultDescription** |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| group.id |  | A string that uniquely identifies the group of consumer processes to which this consumer belongs. By setting the same group id multiple processes indicate that they are all part of the same consumer group. |
| zookeeper.connect |  | Specifies the ZooKeeper connection string in the form `hostname:port` where host and port are the host and port of a ZooKeeper server. To allow connecting through other ZooKeeper nodes when that ZooKeeper machine is down you can also specify multiple hosts in the form `hostname1:port1,hostname2:port2,hostname3:port3`.The server may also have a ZooKeeper chroot path as part of it's ZooKeeper connection string which puts its data under some path in the global ZooKeeper namespace. If so the consumer should use the same chroot path in its connection string. For example to give a chroot path of `/chroot/path` you would give the connection string as`hostname1:port1,hostname2:port2,hostname3:port3/chroot/path`. |
| consumer.id | null | Generated automatically if not set. |
| socket.timeout.ms | 30 \* 1000 | The socket timeout for network requests. The actual timeout set will be max.fetch.wait + socket.timeout.ms. |
| socket.receive.buffer.bytes | 64 \* 1024 | The socket receive buffer for network requests |
| fetch.message.max.bytes | 1024 \* 1024 | The number of bytes of messages to attempt to fetch for each topic-partition in each fetch request. These bytes will be read into memory for each partition, so this helps control the memory used by the consumer. The fetch request size must be at least as large as the maximum message size the server allows or else it is possible for the producer to send messages larger than the consumer can fetch. |
| num.consumer.fetchers | 1 | The number fetcher threads used to fetch data. |
| auto.commit.enable | true | If true, periodically commit to ZooKeeper the offset of messages already fetched by the consumer. This committed offset will be used when the process fails as the position from which the new consumer will begin. |
| auto.commit.interval.ms | 60 \* 1000 | The frequency in ms that the consumer offsets are committed to zookeeper. |
| queued.max.message.chunks | 2 | Max number of message chunks buffered for consumption. Each chunk can be up to fetch.message.max.bytes. |
| rebalance.max.retries | 4 | When a new consumer joins a consumer group the set of consumers attempt to "rebalance" the load to assign partitions to each consumer. If the set of consumers changes while this assignment is taking place the rebalance will fail and retry. This setting controls the maximum number of attempts before giving up. |
| fetch.min.bytes | 1 | The minimum amount of data the server should return for a fetch request. If insufficient data is available the request will wait for that much data to accumulate before answering the request. |
| fetch.wait.max.ms | 100 | The maximum amount of time the server will block before answering the fetch request if there isn't sufficient data to immediately satisfy fetch.min.bytes |
| rebalance.backoff.ms | 2000 | Backoff time between retries during rebalance. If not set explicitly, the value in zookeeper.sync.time.ms is used. |
| refresh.leader.backoff.ms | 200 | Backoff time to wait before trying to determine the leader of a partition that has just lost its leader. |
| auto.offset.reset | largest | What to do when there is no initial offset in ZooKeeper or if an offset is out of range:

\* smallest : automatically reset the offset to the smallest offset

\* largest : automatically reset the offset to the largest offset

\* anything else: throw exception to the consumer |
| consumer.timeout.ms | -1 | Throw a timeout exception to the consumer if no message is available for consumption after the specified interval |
| exclude.internal.topics | true | Whether messages from internal topics \(such as offsets\) should be exposed to the consumer. |
| client.id | group id value | The client id is a user-specified string sent in each request to help trace calls. It should logically identify the application making the request. |
| zookeeper.session.timeout.ms | 6000 | ZooKeeper session timeout. If the consumer fails to heartbeat to ZooKeeper for this period of time it is considered dead and a rebalance will occur. |
| zookeeper.connection.timeout.ms | 6000 | The max time that the client waits while establishing a connection to zookeeper. |
| zookeeper.sync.time.ms | 2000 | How far a ZK follower can be behind a ZK leader |
| offsets.storage | zookeeper | Select where offsets should be stored \(zookeeper or kafka\). |
| offsets.channel.backoff.ms | 1000 | The backoff period when reconnecting the offsets channel or retrying failed offset fetch\/commit requests. |
| offsets.channel.socket.timeout.ms | 10000 | Socket timeout when reading responses for offset fetch\/commit requests. This timeout is also used for ConsumerMetadata requests that are used to query for the offset manager. |
| offsets.commit.max.retries | 5 | Retry the offset commit up to this many times on failure. This retry count only applies to offset commits during shut-down. It does not apply to commits originating from the auto-commit thread. It also does not apply to attempts to query for the offset coordinator before committing offsets. i.e., if a consumer metadata request fails for any reason, it will be retried and that retry does not count toward this limit. |
| dual.commit.enabled | true | If you are using "kafka" as offsets.storage, you can dual commit offsets to ZooKeeper \(in addition to Kafka\). This is required during migration from zookeeper-based offset storage to kafka-based offset storage. With respect to any given consumer group, it is safe to turn this off after all instances within that group have been migrated to the new version that commits offsets to the broker \(instead of directly to ZooKeeper\). |
| partition.assignment.strategy | range | Select between the "range" or "roundrobin" strategy for assigning partitions to consumer streams.The round-robin partition assignor lays out all the available partitions and all the available consumer threads. It then proceeds to do a round-robin assignment from partition to consumer thread. If the subscriptions of all consumer instances are identical, then the partitions will be uniformly distributed. \(i.e., the partition ownership counts will be within a delta of exactly one across all consumer threads.\) Round-robin assignment is permitted only if: \(a\) Every topic has the same number of streams within a consumer instance \(b\) The set of subscribed topics is identical for every consumer instance within the group.Range partitioning works on a per-topic basis. For each topic, we lay out the available partitions in numeric order and the consumer threads in lexicographic order. We then divide the number of partitions by the total number of consumer streams \(threads\) to determine the number of partitions to assign to each consumer. If it does not evenly divide, then the first few consumers will have one extra partition. |

More details about consumer configuration can be found in the scala class`kafka.consumer.ConsumerConfig`.

#### [3.3.2 New Consumer Configs](#newconsumerconfigs)<a id="newconsumerconfigs"></a>

Since 0.9.0.0 we have been working on a replacement for our existing simple and high-level consumers. The code is considered beta quality. Below is the configuration for the new consumer:

| **NameDescriptionTypeDefaultValid ValuesImportance** |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| bootstrap.servers | A list of host\/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster. The client will make use of all servers irrespective of which servers are specified here for bootstrapping—this list only impacts the initial hosts used to discover the full set of servers. This list should be in the form`host1:port1,host2:port2,...`. Since these servers are just used for the initial connection to discover the full cluster membership \(which may change dynamically\), this list need not contain the full set of servers \(you may want more than one, though, in case a server is down\). | list |  |  | high |
| key.deserializer | Deserializer class for key that implements the `Deserializer`interface. | class |  |  | high |
| value.deserializer | Deserializer class for value that implements the `Deserializer`interface. | class |  |  | high |
| fetch.min.bytes | The minimum amount of data the server should return for a fetch request. If insufficient data is available the request will wait for that much data to accumulate before answering the request. The default setting of 1 byte means that fetch requests are answered as soon as a single byte of data is available or the fetch request times out waiting for data to arrive. Setting this to something greater than 1 will cause the server to wait for larger amounts of data to accumulate which can improve server throughput a bit at the cost of some additional latency. | int | 1 | \[0,...\] | high |
| group.id | A unique string that identifies the consumer group this consumer belongs to. This property is required if the consumer uses either the group management functionality by using`subscribe(topic)` or the Kafka-based offset management strategy. | string | "" |  | high |
| heartbeat.interval.ms | The expected time between heartbeats to the consumer coordinator when using Kafka's group management facilities. Heartbeats are used to ensure that the consumer's session stays active and to facilitate rebalancing when new consumers join or leave the group. The value must be set lower than`session.timeout.ms`, but typically should be set no higher than 1\/3 of that value. It can be adjusted even lower to control the expected time for normal rebalances. | int | 3000 |  | high |
| max.partition.fetch.bytes | The maximum amount of data per-partition the server will return. The maximum total memory used for a request will be `#partitions * max.partition.fetch.bytes`. This size must be at least as large as the maximum message size the server allows or else it is possible for the producer to send messages larger than the consumer can fetch. If that happens, the consumer can get stuck trying to fetch a large message on a certain partition. | int | 1048576 | \[0,...\] | high |
| session.timeout.ms | The timeout used to detect failures when using Kafka's group management facilities. When a consumer's heartbeat is not received within the session timeout, the broker will mark the consumer as failed and rebalance the group. Since heartbeats are sent only when poll\(\) is invoked, a higher session timeout allows more time for message processing in the consumer's poll loop at the cost of a longer time to detect hard failures. See also `max.poll.records`for another option to control the processing time in the poll loop. Note that the value must be in the allowable range as configured in the broker configuration by`group.min.session.timeout.ms`and`group.max.session.timeout.ms`. | int | 30000 |  | high |
